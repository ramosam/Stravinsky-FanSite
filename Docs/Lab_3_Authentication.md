### Lab 3 - Authentication

Authentication has been added to the site! A user that tries to go to the Admin page will be prompted for credentials.  The default account to begin testing with is Admin:secret.

Once logged in, certain pages are only available to members, some to admins, and the original project is still open to anonymous users.

Links have been added to the Admin Index page to take the user to handle Role administration. 

The Logout button is available on the Home Index page.

###### Note:  SeedData has been included.
