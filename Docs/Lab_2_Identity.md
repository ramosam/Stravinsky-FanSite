# **CS296 Web-Development**

### Lab 2 - Identity

Project rebuilt using Stravinsky theme on .NET Core 3.1 with a SQLite database.

Previous iterations of the project can be found in ArchivedProject. 

An Admin controller and supporting pages have been added to the Nav bar on the site. There is currently no seed data populating the page. This was intentional to help minimize introducing complications.  



###### Note:  It is intended that seed data will be included in a future release.
