### UPDATE TO TUTORFORUM PROJECT

I am bringing the Stravinsky project onboard to replace the TutorForum. The branch, projectTransition, holds the changes that took place while the TutorForum project was getting moved to ArchivedProject. 

Validation was added to the AddForumQuestion view. The transition-Lab1-validation branch was created to show progress in implementing validation.

The latest changes in the Stravinsky project have been brought forward to the master branch.



Models that have had validation added:

* UserStory
  * Required
  * UIHint
  * StringLength, MinimumLength
* Comment
  * Required
  * UIHint
  * StringLength, MinimumLength



######	Note: Controller validation has not been added explicitly for Comment or MediaRef.
